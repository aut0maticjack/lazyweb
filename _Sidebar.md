## About

This is a wiki of useful advice I commonly give or have seen on places like StackExchange and Reddit. Sometimes I will link directly to useful posts, sometimes I will make a page on here and curate content.

## Money

If you wish to give a financial thanks for any advice, please do not give me anything. Instead, make a donation to an animal rescue charity or environmental charity in your area.
