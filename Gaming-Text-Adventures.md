# Text Adventures

A type of video game popular on home computers and mainframes before graphics were good, or before graphics were even possible. The game describes a scene to you using words and you imagine it in your mind. No 3D acceleration required. Weird, right?

"Text adventure" is an old term. I remember an MS-DOS-based golden era of text adventures written either individually, or in crap limited parsers like [AGT](http://mirror.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXagt.html) or [TADS](https://www.tads.org/). These days this genre is called "interactive fiction" and seems to be mostly written in [Inform](https://twinery.org/) or [Twine](https://twinery.org/) by a close-knit community full of in-jokes and the same dozen or so people all making games at each other.

Here are some "text adventures" I know and like. You might not like these and think they are crap. That's probably expected these days.

This genre led into "graphic adventures" like Space Quest (Sierra adventures) and Day of the Tentacle (LucasArts adventures). Another modern take is "visual novels" which are more like branching choose-your-own-adventure stories, sometimes without any choices (which is called a "kinetic novel").

Some games which blur the line between "text adventure" and "visual novel" are:

* Digital: A Love Story by Christine Love (2010) - [Website](http://scoutshonour.com/digital/)
* Localhost by Aether Interactive (2017) - [itch.io](https://aetherinteractive.itch.io/localhost)

Here are some things which aren't quite text adventures or any of the above, but I'm including them here anyway:

* Castle Adventure by Kevin Bales (1984) - [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/castle-adventure)
* Dracula in London by Stephen D Jones (1988) - [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/dracula-in-london)
