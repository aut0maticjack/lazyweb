# Azur Lane

This Chinese gacha game lets you collect girls who are representations of WW2 warships. Don't ask me I just play the game.

This page is mostly just a copy-paste of some private scrap notes for now. Maybe I'll tidy up later, maybe not.

# Disclaimer

## **Everything on every Azur Lane page is an opinion**

Tier lists are an opinion. Equipment lists are an opinion. "Ship X is better than Ship Y" is an opinion. It's okay to have a different opinion than other people. It's cool to do your own research and find things out for yourself based on evidence and results. It's cool to consider your own individual situation and consider what is best for you and your game, instead of slavishly following others opinions with no logic or understanding.

There is no need to argue about things. Instead, let's enjoy the fact that we all like the same game and discuss aspects of the game like friends.

This is such a well-made and well-balanced game that it can be played in many different ways and still be fun. Let's celebrate that instead of circlejerks and bickering and mocking others.

It's a video game. It's entertainment. **The best way to play is the way which entertains YOU**.

# PVP

I like PVP. If you don't like PVP that's fine, you can skip this section.

## My Current PVP Fleet

* [Warspite Retrofit](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Warspite) (oath) - MK6 406mm, Nepgun, STAAG, Washing Machine, SG Radar
* [King George V](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/King_George_V) - Quad 356mm, Nepgun, STAAG, Washing Machine, SG Radar

    (have also had success with [Duke of York](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Duke_of_York) and MK6 406mm, don't use Hood Gun)
* [Belfast](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Belfast) (oath) - Belgun, Quad Magtorp, Quad Bofors, Rainbow Dildo, Beaver Badge

All L120, max affection, +10 gear. I can win every match I play and have placed in Top 50 for multiple seasons, even getting into Top 10 in the last week of the season several times, so I'm pretty happy with it. Best finishing position at last block of season is 24th place.

Switch position of Warspite/Monarch depending on enemy placement. Sometimes it's better to take out an opposing Hiryuu/Warspite first, sometimes it's not. Not sure why.

Use Google Translate, but it really butchers Chinese phrases sometimes. You have to understand the general idea of the phrase, and sometimes do a lot of thinking or research to logically determine what he's actually saying that Translate obscures.

Nicknames

* Battle-weary = HMS Warspite
* Snow Wind = IJN Yukikaze
* Juno = USS Juneau
* Tiancheng = IJN Amagi
* Feilong / Flying Dragon = IJN Hiryuu
* Xhangmen = IJN Nagato
* Tianlongmen = Amagi Hiryuu Nagato
* Chicheng / Blue Dragon = IJN Akagi
* Dadi / Great / Emperor = KMS Friedrich der Grosse
* Tiandimen = Amagi FdG Nagato
* Azura = IJN Azuma
* Silly White / Li Sha Bai / Yilishabai = HMS Queen Elizabeth

His HMS lineup:

* HMS Monarch, HMS QE, HMS Warspite / HMS Neptune, USS Juneau, USS Seattle
* I don't agree with this backline. QE is too squishy, her buff does not make up for the rest of the weak fleet.

Other Notes:

- XP you earn is apparently "total enemy level * 1.5 + 170" (cv4037786)
- Best HMS CVs - Centaur, Formi, Illustrious (I think everyone knows this anyway)
- **TODO**: Re-read his pages and make study notes with references, he has a lot of good ideas.

## Research Guns

I can never remember what these are from their names or pictures, they all look the damn same, so the listed shots/reload are as they appear on the Depot build screen.

- 30x3  8.05s = CA Triple 203mm (Mle 1934 Prototype) T0 - Second best HE gun - Good, tight spread, quick reload
- 11x3  3.19s = CL Triple 152mm (BL 6" Mk XXV Prototype) T0 - Best AP+ gun - Neptune gun
- 56x3 28.73s = BB Triple 381mm (BL 15" Mk III Prototype) T0 - Second best HE gun - Almost as good as 406mm with more FP, good?
- 12x10x2 24.28s = BB 410mm Mounted = BB Fireworks gun - Crap
- 58x3 30.13s = BB Triple 410mm (10th Year Type Prototype) T0 - Second best AP gun, weak against L but good against H, long reload
- 30x6  9.64s = CA Triple 203mm (SK C/34 Prototype) T0 - Best AP gun - Good, similar to Gold Twin 203mm, maybe more spread means less overall hits?
