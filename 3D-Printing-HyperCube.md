# HyperCube

The HyperCube is a 3D printer by Tech2C. It is intended to provide an upgraded frame and motion to re-use a cheap cartesian (eg: Replikeo i3, Tevo Tarantula, Anet A8, HE3D, etc) and convert it to a cube frame with [corexy](http://www.corexy.com/) kinematics. The parts list is located on Thingiverse at:

## Build Tips

### Scaling Up

* Tech2C gives clear instructions on how to scale the printer up on the Thingiverse page.
* The [HyperCube Materials Calculator](http://funkydiver.com/hypercube-materials) makes this easier.
* People like to talk rubbish about the cantilever bed design, but really for a 200mm or 250mm bed it's fine. For a 300mm or larger bed, two Z screws and 4 Z rods should be used. For a bed larger than 500mm, three Z screws should be used (three points define a plane).
* It may be better to join multiple Z screws with a belt, instead of using multiple motors. If you strongly pull the build platform, you may cause one of dual motors to skip steps and get out of alignment. A belt does not have this problem. The D-Bot community has many good remixes of dual and triple belted Z screws.
* Over 500m bed size the HyperCube starts to become flawed, as linear shafts have a large deflection over long distances, especially heavy steel which must also carry its own weight. If you are concerned about this then look up a shaft deflection calculator, calculate the stock deflection, then the deflection resulting from your intended build. If your deflection is worse, increase rod size.
* At 500mm+ you should be considering a design that does not use linear shafts. Good alternatives are V-slot designs such as the D-Bot, or something that uses linear rails.
* One person building a 1200mm printer found they needed 20mm steel rod or 25mm carbon fiber solid rod to span the X axis, which was an unfeasible rod size.


### Parts

* Corners - Personally I found the Suleve corners on the BOM to be rubbish. I ordered 5 bags, three were so badly made they were useless. Here is a printable internal corner bracket of the same dimensions: [20mm Suleve Corner for 2020 Extrusion (HyperCube) by superjamie](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2379295)
* Nuts - Likewise I found the T-nuts specified on the BOM to be poor quality. Many needed to be filed down on the curve where they are supposed to rotate, or on the top edge furthest from the curve. 5% to 10% of the nuts were just too thick to fit in the extrusion slot and had to be thrown away. Order an extra bag of nuts.
* Carbon fiber tube/rod - Many on the HyperCube Facebook group have purchased their extrusion from HaoZhong Carbon Fiber on eBay. The size is not always guaranteed exact, and varies from 9.95mm to 10.15mm, but the variance within a single tube is less than 0.01mm so is good for plastic/polymer bushings. You can buy 10x8mm or 10x6mm tube, or solid 10mm rod. https://stores.ebay.com/HaoZhong-Carbon-Fiber-Tube

### Tools

* Buy a set of long hex key drivers with the 25Â° ball head, they'll be really useful for getting into hard-to-reach parts of the frame.

### Frame

* Getting the frame square can be quite difficult. It's worth spending time on this. At the end, you should be able to place any side of the frame on a flat surface and have no "clack" as the frame rocks back and forth, it should sit flat on the bench. You should also be able to measure between all extrusions and get the same measurement within say 0.25mm.
* Building on a truly **flat** surface such as a glass/marble counter will help. Don't assemble this somewhere soft, like the carpet or a rickety old wooden desk with uneven feet and one propped-up leg.
* In Artur's Printrbot conversion he describes the idea of making two "windows" from the Y and Z parts, then joining those with the X parts. Arvind agrees this is the best way to assemble a cube frame, it worked well with his FlyingBear P902.
* Make sure all your extrusions are the same length, and are flat on the ends. The D-Bot Facebook group suggest extrusions should be within 1/64" (0.4mm) of each other. I got mine down to half that and checked with a feeler gauge. A file can be used to adjust. Even a small file cuts through the soft aluminium quickly so be careful.
* I measured by extrusions by standing them all on their end, clamping another piece of extrusion each side so they were square, and using a straightedge or another piece of extrusion across the top.
* Additional corner brackets on the outside of the extrusions can help line them up, such as the corner supplied in [HyperCube extensions/modifications by Golkun](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2150132)
* Internal corner brackets which are joined together may be a better idea, such as [Corner Bracket 3 Way for 2020 aluminum extrusion by LuisCRSousa](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1416715)

### Axes

* 10mm rods can be used for the Y axis. The Y does not move so weight doesn't matter, any of steel or aluminium tube or carbon fiber rod/tube can be used.
* The original XY Joiner can be used with Igus bushings (same as for the X axis) with this holder: [Igus 10mm Bushing Holder for LM8LUU by superjamie](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2336683)

### Belts

* The belts need to be evenly tensioned. If the frame is square and the X gantry evenly contacts the frame without belts, but does not evenly contact with belts, then the belts are not evenly tensioned.
* Tying the X gantry to the frame with cable ties and then tightening the belts has solved this for several people.

### Bed and Lead Screw

* Tech2C has a video about motors with internal Z screws.
* Jin found this sprung Z nut holder helped her wobbly Z screw a bit: [Z_Nut_Mount_WobbleFix by syahriansyah](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2103550)
* Even Tech2C comments that the 8mm Z rods are a bit flimsy. A good 10mm Z remix is: [HyperCube LM10UU Z Axis Carriage
by henryarnold](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1950819)

### Electronics

* If buying motors from different suppliers, be aware not all motors have the same pinout at the connector. If in doubt, use a multimeter to figure out which pins are members of the same coil, then swap wires or firmware direction until the motor moves as desired.

## HyperCube Evolution Remix

The HyperCube Evolution by Scott3D is a remix of the original design, adding a stronger 3030 outer frame, more options for X and Y rail sizes, 12mm Z rods for strength, a dual Z screw option for larger beds, and a parametric design scaled up easier.

* [VORON](https://github.com/mzbotreprap/VORON) - Seen by many as the alternative to the HyperCube, default bed is 12" aluminium tooling plate with dual Z screws and an AC heater mat, has a very detailed assembly guide, the creator participates in the community on Reddit and GitHub.
* [FB2020 by AxMod](https://github.com/AxMod3DPrint/FB2020) - Based on several iterations of an older design called the [FuseBox](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1047193), this frame has a horizontal X carriage and a diagnoal cross-brace on the frame. AxMod has 20 of these printers going producing commercial quantities of printed parts, the design has been very reliable for him.
