Everyone loves going large, expanding their D-Bot or HyperCube or Voron or whatever to big print volumes like 300mm, 500mm, or even larger. I'm not really interested in that, I like the idea of small printers! I'm going to call anything with a build volume under a 180mm cube small, and collect some designs here.

## FunBot i1

http://reprap.org/wiki/Funbot_i1

* Build Volume: 165 x 170 x 120
* Cantilever arm based around 10mm smoothrods and M8 threaded rod
* Remix with 8mm smoothrods and proper T8 leadscrew: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1040094

## Monoprice Select Mini v1/v2

https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=21711

* Build Volume: 120 x 120 x 120
* v1 is a straight rebrand of the Malyan M200: http://malyansys.com/en/product/m200/
* v2 apparently has some Monoprice-specific improvements
* 32-bit control board. Runs G-Code but is closed source so no hacking. Apparently easy to brick while flashing official updates
* Uses odd stepper (probably 28BYJ-48) for Z so ideal layer heights are weird
* Many improvements on Thingiverse. Common are filament guide, X axis support, controller fan
* Active community and wiki

## Fabrikator Mini v1

* Build volume: 80 x 80 x 80
* Commercially made TinyBoy: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:701548
* Tom's review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU9RFNzeX04
* Chuck's review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbdlDR-tEfE

Clever belt arrangement.

## Fabrikator Mini v2

* Build volume: 100 x 100 x 100
* Rebranded Malyan M100: http://malyansys.com/en/product/m100/
* Chuck's review of this was not very good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oohJIaQDic0

Seems like a fail.

## MicroCube by Stargrove 1

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1938877

* Build Volume: 120 x 115 x 95
* Tube frame with H-Bot kinematics
* Uses 28BYJ-48 steppers but you can upgrade XY to NEMA17

Now this is cool. I'd love to remake this slightly bigger (250mm frame rods) with CoreXY and keep everything inside the frame (except the top Bowden tube) so it can be enclosed and carried, a laptop charger or a 12V 10A power brick would be enough (no heated bed).

## DICE by purehektic

http://www.instructables.com/id/DICE-a-Tiny-Rigid-and-Superfast-3D-printer/

* Build volume: 90 x 75 x 80
* Laser cut metal frame exactly 20cm cubed 
* MGN linear rails for motion axes
* Genuine E3D V6 hotend
* AZSMZ 32-bit Smoothieware board
* TMC2100 stepper drivers

Pretty incredible no-expense-spared build, though I don't think I'd go this far.

## Bukito by Deezmaker

http://bukito3d.com/

* Build volume: 125 x 150 x 125
* A Kickstarter which actually delivered.
* Claims very fast print speed of 100mm/sec!
