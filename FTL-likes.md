The original. Pilot a single space ship through a series of random galaxies, training your crew and upgrading your ship, in preparation for the final boss battle. Finishing boss battles unlocks further ships.

"Max Max meets FTL". This game places you in vehicles on a planet where you can free-roam, with 4 main objectives to achieve plus a final boss fight to win the game. Rich world with character, distinct factions, lots of side quests, mini-bosses, and various other achievements. If this isn't as good as FTL, it's damn close!

## Star Jumper

* Android
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmdsoftware.starjumper)

A little mobile FTL clone, distilled down to work better on touchscreen. Has 5 ships to unlock. Ends up pretty easy most of the time. Good game and worth a try.

## PSI: Submarine Combat

* Android
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exanosoftware.psi)

A "love letter to FTL", this game places you underwater in mechanics which strive to be like FTP but just miss the mark for me. Not really worth it, but if you do try it, you probably want a 7" screen or larger.
