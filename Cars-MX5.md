# Mazda MX5

There is already a buttload of information out there about these cars, pretty much anything you want to know has already been done and documented, often with photographs and videos. Here is my small drop in the ocean.

Focus on first generation NA/Mk1 (1989-1997) unless otherwise specified.

## Antenna Delete

* M5x20 stainless button head screw, M5 10x1 mm nylon washer. Needs the manual (non-electronic) antenna
* If you have the electric antenna, take the whole antenna out and use a grommet in the body.
