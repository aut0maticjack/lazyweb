### Dummies Guide

I am by no means a mechanical engineer and have only an armchair understanding of these properties.

#### Temperature

* Glass Transition: starts to deform
* Melt Temperature: becomes liquid
* PC best, ABS good, PETG not too bad, PLA and Nylon bad

#### Stretch

* Elastic Modulus (Young's Modulus or Tensile Modulus): higher = less stretchy
* Tensile Strength: higher = resists stretch more
* Nylon best, PC second best, PETG good and will deform at limit, PLA close and will crack quickly at limit

#### Bending

* Flexural Modulus: higher = less bendy
* Flexural Strength: higher = resists bending more
* Nylon best, ABS and PC good and will deform at limit, PLA alright and will crack quickly at limit, PETG a tad weaker and will deform at limit

#### Squish

* Compressive Strength: resists compression more
* PC, Nylon, PETG best, PLA and ABS not so good

#### Breaking

* Elongation: how much a stress curve rises, less means crack, more means deform out of shape
